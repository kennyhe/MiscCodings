Ideas:
Try to solve the problem by set operations. There are following entities:
1) Point, given by input.
2) Line: Each line may contain several points. Each point can belongs to several lines.
3) Code logic:
   Step 1: Pick the first two Points to form a Line;
   Step 2: Loop from the 3rd Point to the last point. When loop to the n'th Point:
       2.1: Create an array onSameLine[0..n -2], the default value of each element of the array is False.
       2.2: Check whether the point belongs to any existing lines;
       2.2: For each line th, then add this Point to that Line, and mark the relevant onSameLine[i] as True for these Points.
