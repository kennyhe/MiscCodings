This is a simple implementation of matrix multiplication.

It reads input from STDin:

Line 1: Number of matrixes (assume it's N)

Line 2: Input N+1 numbers which indicates the height and width of the N matrixes. 
        Each two adjacent matrixes should be multiplicable: 
        The width of the left matrix should be equal to the height of the right matrix.

The output: The minimum count of multiply operation.
